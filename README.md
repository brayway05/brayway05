# My name is Brayden Christensen!

- üè´ Bachelors in CS - Machine Learning @ BYU

I have years of work experience using Python, SQL, React and ExpressJS. I enjoy learning and using new web programming frameworks like FastAPI, Streamlit and React. Most of all, I love leveraging data science and machine learning to explore insights and trends in real-world data. I love to build things and am the most satisfied with my work when I learn that there is a "better" way to do code something whether it's optimzing code performance or writing cleaner and understandle code. 

# Personal Projects

### Nintendo 64 fake cartridge detection model
- Uses the image classifier from `vit-base-patch16-224`
- Model is trained only on 20 or so images.
- Can use API for CURL, Python, or JS on huggingface website
